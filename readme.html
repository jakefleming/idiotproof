<h1 id="idiotproofer"># Idiot Proofer</h1>

<p>Stable release at http://idiotproofed.com.</p>

<p>The Font Testing Page is a tool primarily intended for type designers to &#8216;Drag and Drop&#8217; and quickly test their fonts into a browser. It can also be used by Type and Art Directors, Graphic Designers, Teachers and Students interested in seeing how a typeface works on the web.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Requires Firefox or Chrome</li>
<li>No server storage is used, fonts are stored in your browser, then embedded directly from there into a PDF that is unaccessable to us.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>This entire thing is built on the work of other people!</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://axis-praxis.org">Axis Praxis</a>, which kindly uses very readable javascript in their source.</li>
