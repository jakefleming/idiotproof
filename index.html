                The small country town of Cambridge lies on the Waikato River, amidst gentle farmlands, trees, old churches and echoes of a village green, with a temperate climate that would please those used to the bitter East Anglian winds that blow across the wintry fens of its English counterpart. Here Arthur F. B. Broadhurst, an Englishman and enthusiastic viola player, chose to found his boys’ preparatory school of St. Peter’s, which soon came to reflect his own love of music through the opportunities he gave his young charges. The buildings were grouped in a leisurely, spacious fashion over a sculpted, folding landscape and included, besides dormitories, a large hall, a chapel, plenty of practice rooms and a swimming pool. When Owen Jensen, the energetic young music tutor to the Community Arts Service, attached to Auckland University College, sought a suitable venue for a summer school of music he was about to launch, a friendly fate led him to choose St. Peter’s. Owen Jensen had organised teaching, music appreciation classes and concerts in Auckland and the surrounding area. His forthright journal Music Ho! had a national audience. His Cambridge Summer School of Music was to influence a young country’s musical life more profoundly than anything he had hitherto done. With great percipience he invited the composer Douglas Lilburn to be resident composer, to help with the conducting, and to talk to the whole school. The following year Lilburn returned and took the first composers’ classes. Douglas Lilburn, youngest son of a predominantly Scottish farming family, from the Drysdale sheep station near Hunterville, had shown musical gifts while at Canterbury University College under the redoubtable Dr J. C. Bradshaw, who embodied many of the tested and unchanged virtues of the 19th-century English organist and choirmaster. In 1936, while in the midst of studies, Lilburn won a composition prize offered by the visiting pianist and composer Percy Grainger, with Forest, a tone poem, praised by the judges in terms which were soon to be proved prophetic and performed by the Wellington Symphony Orchestra under Leon de Mauny in 1937. By now Lilburn had decided upon music as his profession, rather than literature, for which he was equally qualified, and went to the Royal College of Music in London to study under Vaughan Williams. In 1939 his Fantasy Quartet won the Cobbett Prize. The following year his Aotearoa Overture opened the historic Centennial Matinee at His Majesty’s Theatre in the Haymarket, conducted by Warwick Braithwaite with the Sadler’s Wells Orchestra. It had been written for the occasion in two weeks. When Lilburn returned to New Zealand in 1940, the year of the Centennial celebrations, he learned that he had won three out of the four prizes offered for musical compositions to mark the occasion. His significant Landfall in Unknown Seat. incidental music to Allen Curnow’s poem to commemorate the tercentenary of the discovery of New Zealand by Abel Tasman, followed in 1942. By the time of this first Cambridge Summer School he was already a composer of considerable originality and achievement. Douglas Lilburn was not the first of New Zealand composers, for that honour, as he makes clear, fell to Alfred Hill (1870-1960). Hill had been declared by the New Zealand Timer of 15 March 1892, on his departure to study in Leipzig, as ‘among the first of what we believe will be a long line of musicians destined to rise in this colony, for there are many indications that these southern lands will become the home of art’. Originally, this talk had no formal title and that now given it parallels a later occasion when shortly before receiving an honorary Doctorate of Music from the University of Otago in 1969, Douglas Lilburn spoke on ‘A Search for a Language’. Nearly forty years have elapsed since that first halcyon summer school. This first publication of the talk, printed as it was given, commemorates the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Archive of New Zealand Music at the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington. The composer demurred from publication at the time, perhaps believing that it was his primary role to speak through his music, thus belying in a way the beliefs of his mentor Vaughan Williams, whose writings he quotes here, or perhaps feeling that its clear directives were insufficiently appreciated. Yet students described it as ‘memorable’. For composers working within an unformulated musical inheritance Douglas Lilburn sums up their position in time, in society, in history with concision. He places in perspective the irritations, frustrations, doubts and difficulties of a young composer. He clears the ground and opens it up sweepingly. He throws out points about the relative importance of the various elements of music and emphasises rhythm, which in his view shapes melody. He considers sympathetically and from firsthand knowledge, the kind of problems New Zealand composers might be expected to face. Since 1946, successive generations of talented and gifted composers have established themselves. They have won acclaim and recognition overseas. Some are exploring and assimilating the traditions of the Pacific area. Yet at the time of this talk some of the young composers seemed to turn their backs on the advice offered and follow well-beaten paths. Time has by no means invalidated the issues Douglas Lilburn discusses here. Publication is an important event. This talk will always remain, if not a solitary sentinel rock with a finger pointing to the sky, at the very least, in a human context, the cry of the watchman who heralds the dawn.
