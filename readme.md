# Idiot Proofer

Stable release at http://idiotproofed.com.

The Font Testing Page is a tool primarily intended for type designers to 'Drag and Drop' and quickly test their fonts into a browser. It can also be used by Type and Art Directors, Graphic Designers, Teachers and Students interested in seeing how a typeface works on the web.

## Notes

* Requires Firefox or Chrome
* No server storage is used, fonts are stored in your browser, then embedded directly from there into a PDF that is unaccessable to us.

## Thanks

This entire thing is built on the work of other people!

* Most thanks to Pablo Impallari's [Font Testing Page](https://github.com/impallari/Font-Testing-Page/) which has been down for several months and forced us to come up with a replacement.
* [Axis Praxis](http://axis-praxis.org), which kindly uses very readable javascript in their source.
* Latin02 Diacritics tabs from [Context of Diacritics](http://urtd.net/projects/cod)
